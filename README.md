# Needajobinafrica.com
This is a microverse capstone project to build a directory website. My website is a job directory to find jobs for professionals in Africa. It has three pages (homepage, search and search result pages) for different job openings and a detailed page for a particular job.
This is a solo project to build a responsive website using HTML5, bootstrap &amp; CSS.
